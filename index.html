    <h1>Odin Recipes!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my favorite recipes!</p>
    <p>OK, I admit it, I'm a lazy cook. I got too comfortable living by myself when I could shop and buy what I wanted, and eat when I wanted. </p>
    <p>Well, things change! I've been married for 8 years and have a six-year-old. She needs to eat. She's a beast. And I don't want her to eat junk.</p>
    <p>These recipes are fast and healthy. Or at least homemade. Enjoy!</p>
